/**
 * Updates the vehicle logic automatically for the current movement
 *
 * The AI will only be activated if the distance between the vehicle and the player is less than or equal to the distance
 * of rendering (rectangles that the player sees).
 *
 * AI aggressiveness is within the class (probAI). It is a value between 0 and 1 that indicates the probability of
 * that the AI act in this movement.
 *
 * If the AI aggressiveness is 0, the movement will be as in the original game, i.e. the car will continue
 * at a constant speed without going off the road and following a straight path or with a turn (chosen
 * randomly) and without being influenced by the player.
 *
 * If the aggressiveness of the AI is 1, the movement will be controlled by the AI and its movement will depend on the type
 * of AI:
 * OBSTACLE: Attempts to collide with the player by getting in his path and trying to catch him.
 * EVASIVE: Flees to the lane furthest from the player to try to avoid him.
 * INCONSTANT: Changes lanes too often regardless of the player's position.
 *
 * If the aggressiveness of the AI is between 0 and 1, it performs one of the two actions described (original
 * or AI) with probability p that the AI will act and p' = (1 - p) that it will be as in the original.
 *
 * @param c is the module configuration of the game
 * @param playerPosX is the position of the traffic car in the axis x
 * @param playerPosY is the position of the traffic car in the axis y
